# Project1-Yelp_API

I completed this project for the Academy Xi Data Analytics Elevate short course on 14 August 2021.
It is one of two projects for the course, and focused on using Python to extract data from the Yelp API and analysing it with Pandas dataframe function and methods, as well as visualising the data with Matplotlib and Folium.
The project found that there was a correlation between price and rating for pizza restaurants in New York City, where the higher the price of the pizza, the better the rating it received. However, there was minimal dependency on the number of reviews received and the rating of the restaurant.
